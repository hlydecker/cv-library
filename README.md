- [Grounded SAM Custom](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/grounded-segment-anything-colab/blob/main/grounded-segment-anything-custom.ipynb): This Colab is mostly interesting because it shows how to use a Google Colab to deploy a Gradio web app that can have a public facing URL. In theory this allows users to adaptively conjure GPU inference applications for free!!! Standard Colab pros and cons apply.
