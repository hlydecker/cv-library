Useful papers, notebooks, and guides for computer vision work.

## Papers

- [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/yolo_1.pdf): The original YOLO paper. A useful read to understand the core underpinnings of one of the most popular models for real world computer vision applications.
- [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf): What a classic. A very fun and enjoyable read from the creator of YOLO that raises some interesting questions about the broader CV space.


## Demos

## Notebooks

- [Grounded SAM Custom](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/grounded-segment-anything-colab/blob/main/grounded-segment-anything-custom.ipynb): This Colab is mostly interesting because it shows how to use a Google Colab to deploy a Gradio web app that can have a public facing URL. In theory this allows users to adaptively conjure GPU inference applications for free!!! Standard Colab pros and cons apply.
