Useful papers, notebooks, and guides for computer vision work.

üöß ‚ö†Ô∏è This repo is very WIP and will likely undergo extensive changes as I add in content and reformat it to make it more useful. ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß

Very open to contributions üòâ

## Papers

- [You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/yolo_1.pdf): The original YOLO paper. A useful read to understand the core underpinnings of one of the most popular models for real world computer vision applications.
- [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf): What a classic. A very fun and enjoyable read from the creator of YOLO that raises some interesting questions about the broader CV space.
- [Grounding DINO: Marrying DINO with Grounded Pre-Training for Open-Set Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499): A very impressive implementation of a multimodal open-set object detector. By combining a highly performant Transformer object detector (DINO) with a LLM, this model can detect arbitrary objects with human inputs such as category names or referring expressions. Excellent documentation and open source code on their [GitHub](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO).

## Demos

## Notebooks

- [Grounded SAM Custom](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camenduru/grounded-segment-anything-colab/blob/main/grounded-segment-anything-custom.ipynb): This Colab is mostly interesting because it shows how to use a Google Colab to deploy a Gradio web app that can have a public facing URL. In theory this allows users to adaptively conjure GPU inference applications for free!!! Standard Colab pros and cons apply.
